Ranking Evaluation With Case Distinguishability Using Greatness of Divergence Relevance Functions

In this repository you will find the code and data used to execute the experimental process (designed for R) in the submitted article "Ranking Evaluation With Case Distinguishability Using Greatness of Divergence Relevance Functions". 

This article was written by Nuno Moniz and Lu√≠s Torgo. It was submitted to the 2nd ACM International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval (2016).

Figure1.R : R Code to generate Figure 1<br/>
GoD_phi.R : R Code to interpolate relevance according to the magnitude of their divergence<br/>
SyntheticExps.R : R Code to replicate synthetic experiments described in the paper and to generate Figure 2<br/>
RealWorldExps.R : R Code to replicate real world experiments described in the paper and to generate Figure 3<br/>

CSV's contain the data used to replicate the real world experiments (Figure 3)
